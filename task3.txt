Database Questions:
1.database view: 
It is a sort of virtual table which may have data, selected from one or more tables.
The view is stored in the database as an object but result is not stored in the table.
It is implemented mostly for security reasons when we don't want the whole table or data to be shared with users. 
Then users can use, query the selected view as a normal table.

2.Foreign key:
It is columnname (primary key) of one table to be used in another table to link the two tables in relational database.

3.table scan:
It is the process of reading every row in the table. It usually happens when there is no index during search queries. 
A table scan can cause performance issue while dealing with very large tables so while querying the data we should 
avoid table scan by having specific conditions so as to search the specific data instead of whole data.

4.Largetst value:
The largest value of acolumn can be found by MAX(column_name)

5.Inner and Outer Join:
Inner join displays the data which is common to the joining tables. Outer join can be Left , right or full.
In left join the data displayed include all the data from the table on the left of join and data in the right table
matching with left table. the same is with right join with right replacing the left in perspective.
In full join data from both the tables will be included whether matchinh or not.
